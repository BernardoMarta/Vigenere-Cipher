# Vigenère Cipher Implementation

## About the Project
This project implements the Vigenère Cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher used for encrypting alphabetic text. It includes two different versions of the cipher implementation.

## How It Works
The project consists of two main functions for each version:

1. **First Version** (`vigenere` and `rodar`):
   - Uses ASCII values to compute the shift.
   - Implements the cipher using character-to-integer conversions.

2. **Second Version** (`vigenere2` and `rodar2`):
   - Uses a predefined alphabet string to determine shifts.
   - Implements the cipher using index-based operations on the alphabet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version by running:

python --version

### Installation
Clone the repository or download the Python file manually:

git clone https://github.com/BernardoMarta/Vigenere-Cipher
cd Vigenere-Cipher


## Usage

### Using the First Version:
To use the first version of the Vigenère Cipher, refer to the function definitions in the code.

### Using the Second Version:
To use the second version of the Vigenère Cipher, refer to the function definitions in the code.

## Example

**Input:**
Example input values are provided in the code comments.

**Output (Both Versions):**
Example output is provided in the code comments.

## Features
- Two different implementations of the Vigenère Cipher
- Supports lowercase alphabetic input
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure
